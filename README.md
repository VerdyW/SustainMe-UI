# SustainMe-UI

This project is created by myself using SwiftUI in Xcode for learning purposes. SustainMe User Inteface design is created by myself for my assignment. This Swift UI project is one of the projects I use to learn Swift programming. The UI is created using ZStack, HStack, and VStack to organize the items inside the UI. There is 2 page that i have created using SwiftUI which are Sign In Page and Home Page. Sign In page is in LoginPage.swift file and Home Page is in ContentView.swift file
